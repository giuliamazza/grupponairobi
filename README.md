# 🌍 Build a School in Kenya — Charity Website

Welcome to the official repo for the charity stream website project supporting the construction of a primary school in Kenya!

This is a fun and meaningful way to get involved — not only do you get to practice your web dev/design skills, but your contribution will help raise visibility and funds for a real educational project. 💚

---

## 💡 What's this about?

We're building a landing page to promote a charity initiative by \*Gruppo Nairobi\*, a non-profit building a 6-classroom school for kids in the Machakos District, Kenya. The website will help us collect donations, tell the story, and show progress.

But this repo is not just about the cause — it's also about creativity and collaboration. If you love designing or coding, **this is your playground**.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

1. Fork this repo
2. Build your version of the site (HTML/CSS/JS or any stack you like but consider we are trying to keep it as simple as possible, so less work will be needed in the future)
3. Deploy it using GitHub Pages (or any other way you prefer)
4. Let G know by opening an issue or messaging directly

We're looking for:
- Web devs (HTML/CSS/JS or frameworks like React, Vue, etc.)
- Designers (create new layouts or improve existing design)
- UX people (think about how to make donation flow super smooth)
- Animators, illustrators, writers — you name it!
